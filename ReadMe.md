Word and Sentence Embedding using NLTK, Gensim, and Transformer Models
This project demonstrates how to compute word embeddings and sentence embeddings using NLTK, Gensim, and Transformer models. It showcases:

Pre-processing of text data.
Creation of word vectors using traditional approaches.
Leveraging transformer-based models for contextualized sentence embeddings.


Features
1. Text Preprocessing
Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization using NLTK.
Handling noisy data, punctuation, and case normalization to clean text for processing.
2. Word Embeddings (Gensim)
Generate word embeddings using:
Word2Vec (train your own or use pre-trained models).
FastText for subword-level embeddings.
Pre-trained GloVe models for general-purpose embeddings.
Train a Word2Vec model on a custom dataset for domain-specific tasks.
3. Sentence Embeddings (Transformers)
Generate contextualized sentence embeddings using transformer-based models, including:
BERT
Sentence-BERT
Hugging Face Embeddings
Torch-based transformer models
Explore the embeddings for advanced semantic tasks.
